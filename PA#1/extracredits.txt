I did not implement any fuzzy search or autocomplete features so misspelled names are an issue.  However, searches with partial names still returns relevant results such as ‘Jos’ or ‘osh’ returns many names with ‘Josh’.

For the design of the page, I chose a relevant background of the hardwood of a basketball court and included the NBA logo and basketball hoop images.  I selected those specific images because of their blue color.  Blue and orange is a very popular and well received color scheme and I thought it work with the hardwood court background, as well as the blue submit button.  For the results table, I made the background a different shade of orange for readability of the text.  I put the data into tables.  The table headings are bold so they are more distinguishable.  I used a thin white dotted border throughout the table for readability across the player row as well as to accentuate the white of the search bar, which balances with the blue and orange.  I also implemented Bootstrap so that the page would be responsive to screen width.  The images go away and the text decreases in size under 893px screen width.  Under 768px, the font size decreases again.  Under 432px, the text and the heading size decrease.  This was important because at a smaller width, the table scrunched together and made it unreadable.
